# AAM Readiness Assessment — Keystone Heights Airport (42J)

An interactive readiness report for Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) operations at Keystone Heights Airport (42J). Built with React and Vite.

The dashboard presents the results of a 90-day Monte Carlo simulation across 9 infrastructure-traffic scenarios, and provides analysis across safety gates, power requirements, route demand, and phased deployment planning.

## What's Inside

- **9-Scenario Results Matrix** — click any cell to see why it passed, failed, or was flagged as optimal
- **Gate Assessment** — FAA safety and power readiness pass/fail checks
- **Recommended Configuration** — optimal Vertiport build-out spec for 42J
- **Phased Deployment Roadmap** — 36-month implementation plan with CAPEX estimates
- **eVTOL Route Demand Analysis** — 6 destination corridors modeled within 50-mile range
- **Grant Planning Tool** — interactive traffic tier toggle with Chart.js visualizations and grant justification copy

## Data

All simulation results are currently hardcoded in `src/data/`. The values are derived from:

- 50,236 actual operations at 42J (May 2024 – March 2026)
- 90-day Monte Carlo simulation across 9 infrastructure-traffic scenarios
- Demand modeling for 6 population centres within a 50-mile range envelope

> This assessment is for preliminary planning purposes and does not constitute an FAA-approved engineering study. Infrastructure recommendations should be validated by a licensed FAA DER before use in ALP submissions or grant applications.
